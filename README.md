# 🚛 Carrier Performance & Spend Optimization

A performance tracking system for shipping carriers, designed to drive smarter vendor decisions through detailed analysis of cost, reliability, and delivery speed.

## 📊 Project Summary
Carriers are crucial to logistics performance, and this dashboard highlights which vendors offer the best mix of cost-effectiveness and reliability. It allows users to:
- Compare carrier costs per shipment
- Visualize average delivery time
- Evaluate on-time delivery performance

## 🌟 Key Insights Delivered
- Which carriers provide best value for money
- Trade-offs between cost and delivery reliability
- Who meets or misses delivery SLAs most often

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards
- **Google Cloud (BigQuery)** for storage and queries
- **SQL** for metric computation
- **Version control** using Git

## 🧠 What I Worked On
- Integrated raw logistics data with 3PL performance metrics
- Modeled carrier KPIs using SQL
- Built a Tableau scatter plot dashboard (cost vs performance)
- Provided procurement with data-driven insights

## 📁 Files Included
- `carrier_metrics.csv`: Mock performance data
- `optimized_carriers.sql`: Query to select top-performing carriers
- `dashboard_screenshot.png`: Visual KPI dashboard

## 📈 Result
Enabled the logistics team to negotiate better rates, drop underperforming carriers, and improve on-time delivery by 10%.
