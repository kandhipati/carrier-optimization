# Project Notes: Carrier Performance & Spend Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize carrier selection by analyzing performance metrics such as delivery times, costs, and on-time rates. The analysis helps identify carriers that deliver the best value and reliability.

## Key Observations
- Carriers with lower costs tend to have slightly longer delivery times.
- Visualizations help reveal outliers and potential areas for negotiation.

## Future Enhancements
- Use machine learning to predict future performance trends.
- Incorporate real-time data feeds for dynamic updates.
- Develop interactive dashboards for deeper analysis.

## Challenges
- Balancing cost with delivery speed and reliability.
- Integrating data from multiple sources for a comprehensive view.
